Each satellite will generate more than 20-kW of power and will have a large unfurlable antenna reflector; which enables broadcast to radios without the need for large dish-type antennas on the ground.  SXM-8 is meant to replace the XM-4 satellite. SXM-7 was meant to replace the XM-3, but suffered a failure in orbit 6 weeks after its launch.",
