The other 4 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites are to be launched at a later date.\r\n\r\nThey will be launched to low Earth orbit between 600 and 700 km by 2025, enabling South Korea\u2019s military to observe the nuclear-armed neighbor\u2019s key military facilities every two hours with 30-50 centimeters resolution imagery, according to a 2019 report produced by the Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning.\r\n\r\nThe project is lead by the Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), with input from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), Hanwha Systems and Thales Alenia Space.\r\n\r\nESA's EIRSAT-1 is also onboard as a rideshare passenger. This 2U cubesat carries three experiments, including a novel gamma ray detector to study some of the most luminous explosions in the universe.",
