The experiments onboard include the Soret Coefficient in Crude Oil (SCCO) experiments, as well as experiments on radiation, combustion, and biology. Due to the short lifespan and retrievable design the craft will not be encapsulated within a fairing and will be powered by chemical batteries instead of solar panels.",
