The scientific payload of the satellite is an H\u03b1 imaging spectrograph (HIS), which can, for the first time, acquire full-disk spectroscopic solar observations in the H\u03b1 waveband. It will complement the observations by on-orbit solar spacecraft (such as SDO, IRIS, STEREO and PSP), as well as future solar missions of the Solar Orbiter and the Chinese Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S).\r\nMission is named Xihe after a solar deity from Chinese mythology.",
