It will dock at Zvezda's nadir port, replacing the Pirs module occupying it since September 2001. The Nauka module is designed to be used for experiments, docking and cargo as well as serve as a crew work and rest area. It is equipped with full guidance and navigation control including engines and an attitude control system that can be used as a backup by the ISS. The Nauka module also brings the European Robotic Arm, for which a spare elbow joint was already launched in 2010, to the orbital laboratory.",
