The satellites operate on a 500 km circular sun synchronous orbit. Electrical power is provided by two deployable solar panels that is stored on onboard batteries.\r\n\r\nThey are equipped with a three-dimensional survey camera and a CCD camera with a ground resolution of 5 meters, spectral region of 0.51 \u00b5m to 0.69 \u00b5m and with a camera angle of 25 degrees. Also on board is a multi-spectral camera with a ground resolution of 10 meters operating in four spectral bands of 0.43 \u00b5m to 0.52 \u00b5m, 0.52 \u00b5m to 0.61 \u00b5m, 0.61 \u00b5m to 0.69 \u00b5m, and 0.76 \u00b5m to 0.90 \u00b5m.
