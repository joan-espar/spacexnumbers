A secondary function is performance enhancement, increasing the accuracy and reliability of GPS derived navigation solutions.\r\nQZS-1R is a replacement satellite for QZS-1 which was launched in 2010.",

It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was formed, and is now run by JAXA. The activities that take place at TNSC include assembly, testing, launching, and tracking satellites, as well as rocket engine firing tests.",
