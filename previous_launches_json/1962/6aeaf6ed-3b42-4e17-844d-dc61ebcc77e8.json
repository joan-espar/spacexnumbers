While the mission is considered a success it had several issues, a malfunction in the life-support systems caused the cabin temp drop to 10C but Popovich continued the mission, the big issue came when he mentioned seeing thunderstorms. He saw actual thunderstorms in the Gulf of Mexico but mission control thought Popovich had said a codeword for early mission ending and the mission was cut a day short. He completed 48 orbits and the mission lasted 2 days, 22 hours & 56 minutes.",
