They docked with Mir two days later. During their stay there, cosmonauts performed several EVAs and various scientific experiments in medicine, biotechnology, Earth sciences etc. Station crew was visited by several Progress resupply spacecrafts, STS-91, and welcomed aboard Soyuz TM-28 with the next expedition crew. \nThe mission concluded with a safe landing back on Earth on August 25, 1998, 05:24:44 UTC.",
