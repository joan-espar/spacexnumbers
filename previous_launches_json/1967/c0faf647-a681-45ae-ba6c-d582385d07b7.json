PRIME 2 was launched on 5 March 1967. This flight simulated a 1053 km cross range re-entry, and banking at hypersonic speeds. Several stringers on the main parachute failed to cut which lead to the loss of the vehicle.",

The last Atlas V launch from SLC-3E happened in November 2022, with the first Vulcan launch expected in 2025.",
