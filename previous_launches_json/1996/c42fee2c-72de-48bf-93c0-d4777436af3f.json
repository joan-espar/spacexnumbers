They docked with Mir two days later. During their stay there, cosmonauts performed several EVAs and various scientific experiments. Station crew was visited by several Progress resupply spacecrafts, STS-79 and STS-81, and welcomed aboard Soyuz TM-25 with the next expedition crew. \nThe mission concluded with a safe landing back on Earth on  March 2, 1997, 06:44:16 UTC.",
