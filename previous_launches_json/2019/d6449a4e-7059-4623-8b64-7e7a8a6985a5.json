Although Atlas V and Centaur upper stage successfully put Starliner into planned trajectory, the spacecraft was unable to perform a nominal orbital insertion. Preliminary analysis indicate that Mission Elapsed Time (MET) system error led to Starliner burning more fuel than expected. Spacecraft is healthy and in stable orbit, but won't be able to reach and dock with ISS. Landing at White Sands Facility is planned on Dec 22.",
