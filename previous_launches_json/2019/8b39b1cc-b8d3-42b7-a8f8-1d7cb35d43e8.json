        "description": "Eutelsat 5 West B will replace the Ku-band capacity of Eutelsat 5 West A (formerly Stellat 5) satellite, a key digital infrastructure addressing predominantly French, Italian and Algerian broadcast markets. Eutelsat 5 West B will provide business continuity and improved quality for these services via a Ku-band payload. The satellite is built on Orbital ATKs GEOStar-2e bus and carries 35 equivalent 36 MHz Ku-band transponders connected to three service areas. Switchable transponders will also increase commercial flexibility.\n\nCo-passenger on this flight will be provided Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. MEV-1 (Mission Extension Vehicle-1) incorporates flight-proven technologies the company has used in its commercial satellite and space logistics businesses. After successfully completing a series of in-orbit tests, the MEV-1 will begin its mission extension service for Intelsat-901 satellite in the graveyard orbit. MEV-1 will relocate the satellite scheduled for the mission extension service, which is planned for a five-year period, after which Intelsat 901 will be place back into graveyard orbit. Intelsat will also have the option to service multiple satellites using the same MEV.\n\nMEV-1 is based on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GEOStar-3 spacecraft bus platform. Controlled by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite operations team, the MEV-1 uses a reliable, low-risk docking system that attaches to existing features on a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite. The MEV-1 provides life-extending services by taking over the propulsion and attitude control functions. The vehicle has a 15-year design life with the ability to perform numerous dockings and undockings during its life span.",
