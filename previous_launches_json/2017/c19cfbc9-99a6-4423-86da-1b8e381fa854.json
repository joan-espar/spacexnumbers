In addition, the satellite will measure ozone levels and reflected solar radiation from the planet.JPSS 1 will survey the entire globe twice per day with five sensor packages.The satellite will replace the existing Suomi NPP spacecraft that launched in 2011 for a five-year mission as a gapfiller between NOAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy weather satellite constellation and the new JPSS generation.",
