The satellite will provide Mobile Satellite Services (MSS), Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) and Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS). It is equipped with Ka/S-band payload, 47 Ku-band transponders, 1 Ka-band transponder. Weighing 5900 kg at launch, the satellite is to reside in geostationary orbit in an orbital position 39\u00c2\u00b0 East, where it is expected to operate for about 15 years. GSAT-17 is a communication satellite with a lift off mass of 3425 kg and 6 KW power generation capacity. The satellite's commercial transponders include Ku-band, Normal C-band and Extended C-band transponders. It additionally carries a dedicated transponder for data relay (DRT) and search-and-rescue (SAR) services.",
