They docked with the station next day. During their stay on the station, cosmonauts assisted resident Soyuz T-13 crew with numerous repairs on the station. They also conducted some scientific experiments. Georgi Grechko returned to Earth early with the Soyuz T-13 crew member.\nThe mission concluded with a safe landing back on Earth on November 21, 1985, 10:31:00 UTC.",
