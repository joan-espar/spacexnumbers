Such formation flying will be maintained for 6 hours, creating \u2033artificial solar eclipse\u2033 for the satellite below. \r\n\r\nThe spacecraft pair will fly a highly elliptical orbit divided between periods of accurate formation flying around apogee, when payload operations will be possible, and periods of free flight.",
