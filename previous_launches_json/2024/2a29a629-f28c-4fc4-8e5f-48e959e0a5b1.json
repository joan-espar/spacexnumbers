The primary payload POLIX (Polarimeter Instrument in X-rays) will measure the polarimetry parameters (degree and angle of polarization) in medium X-ray energy range of 8-30 keV photons of astronomical origin. The XSPECT (X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing) payload will give spectroscopic information in the energy range of 0.8-15 keV.\r\n\r\nIn addition, 10 attached payloads on the PSLV 4th stage will perform various experiments and testing from Indian institutions coordinated by ISRO, known as PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3 (POEM-3).",
