ETS-VII (Engineering Test Satellite, \"Kiku 7\") was launched aboard the H-2 No. 6 rocket from Tanegashima Space Center in November 1997.mETS-VII itself comprises two satellites: \"Orihime\" and \"Hikoboshi\". \"Orihime\" is a target satellite weighing approximately 400 kilograms. It is placed in a fixed circular orbit at an altitude of roughly 550 kilometers. \"Hikoboshi\" is a chaser satellite, weighing some 2.5 tons. It moves in a variable orbit to rendezvous and dock with \"Orihime\". \"Hikoboshi\" is equipped with a six-jointed, three-clawed robot arm two meters long.",

It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was formed, and is now run by JAXA. The activities that take place at TNSC include assembly, testing, launching, and tracking satellites, as well as rocket engine firing tests.",
