During their 211-day stay on the station, crew performed various scientific and medical experiments, and were visited by 4 uncrewed cargo Progress vehicles and 2 Soyuz missions. Soyuz T-5 crew, per usual, swapped vehicles with the visiting Soyuz T-7 crew, which allowed for a longer stay in orbit.\nCosmonauts returned in the Soyuz T-7 spacecraft, landing safely back on Earth on December 10, 1982, 19:02:36 UTC.",
