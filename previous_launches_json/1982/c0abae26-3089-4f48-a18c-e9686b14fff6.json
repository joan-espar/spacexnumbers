They docked with the station the next day. During their 7-day stay on the station, crew performed various scientific and medical experiments. Soyuz T-7, per usual, swapped their vehicles with the resident Soyuz T-5 crew, which allowed for a longer stay on the station.\nThe crew returned in Soyuz T-5 spacecraft, landing safely back on Earth on August 27, 1982, 15:04:16 UTC.",
