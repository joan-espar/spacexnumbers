Hispasat 1A was launched in September 1992, and Hispasat 1B in July 1993. From its orbital position of 30 degrees West above the Atlantic and close to the Brazilian coast, this was the first European satellite system to provide transatlantic capacity, simultaneously covering all the Latin American countries and the United States, areas that have a great deal in common both culturally and linguistically.",
