The mission began on June 5, 1980, 14:19:30 UTC, launching Commander Yury Malyshev and Flight Engineer Vladimir Aksyonov into orbit. They docked with the station the next day. During their 2-day stay on the station, crew carried out few scientific experiments. After Soyuz T-2 undocked, its crew photographed and visually inspected the space station. \nThe mission concluded with a safe landing back on Earth on June 9, 1980, 12:39:00 UTC.",
