They docked with the station the next day. During their 7-day stay on the station, EP-5 crew conducted various scientific experiments, including measuring radiation doses received by the crew. Soyuz 36 swapped vehicles with the resident station crew, and returned in Soyuz 35 spacecraft.\nThe mission concluded with a safe landing back on Earth on June 3, 1980, 15:06 UTC.",
