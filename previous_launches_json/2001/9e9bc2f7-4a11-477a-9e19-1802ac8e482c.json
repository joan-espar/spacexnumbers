By meeting a rapid delivery schedule (16 month on ground delivery), which is made possible by an advanced production policy for the Spacebus-3000B2 platform, Alcatel Space has enabled Eutelsat to meet crucial back-up service requirements while expanding digital and multimedia services. In addition to the on-ground delivery of Atlantic Bird 2, Alcatel Space's prime contract with Eutelsat provides for the satellite's launch campaign, as well support for its operations and mission analysis.",
