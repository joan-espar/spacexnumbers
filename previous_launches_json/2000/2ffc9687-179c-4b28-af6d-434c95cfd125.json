It was then bought by Eutelsat as spare satellite, called RESSAT, which was later renamed Eutelsat W1 as a replacement satellite compatible with their previously-launched W2 and W3 spacecraft. Eutelsat subsequently decided to launch W1 in September 2000. Located at the 10 degrees East position, the satellite serves a full range of applications that include that include business communications, Internet-based services and television transmission. It has 28 channels, 20 of which provide coverage of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and central Asia via a fixed widebeam, with the remaining eight connected to a steerable spotbeam, to address new markets in geographical areas outside the widebeam coverage area (notably southern Africa). Services can be simultaneously provided within both coverages.",
