        "description": "The SESAT 1 (Siberia - Europe SATellite) provides a wide range of telecommunications services over a very large geographical coverage area extending from the Atlantic Ocean to Eastern Russia, including a large part of Siberia. The satellite also provides similar services within the Indian Sub-Continent by means of a Steerable Spotbeam. Sharing the 36\u00b0 East orbital position with the Eutelsat W4 satellite, SESAT contributes to the development of international, regional and domestic services, such as thin route telephony, corporate and specialised data services and long distance trunk telephony. It facilitates the development of new markets in far eastern Europe and southern Asia for all types of telecommunication and business services, as well as providing full interconnectivity with western and central Europe.",
