Initially designed with a pulsed-plasma thruster to train Air Force Academy cadets (see JAWSAT), the mission has since evolved to include the efforts of several universities, local aerospace companies, the Air Force Academy, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and NASA. Utilizing breakthrough technologies, JAWSAT deployed four satellites when it reached orbit. The onboard imaging system recorded the deployment of each payload with its six digital cameras. The first free-flying Academy satellite, FalconSat-1 carried the CHAWS (Charging Hazards and Wake Studies) experiment developed by the Physics Department at the Academy.",
