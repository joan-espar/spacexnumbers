        "description": "StriX \u03b2 is a Japanese synthetic aperture radar satellite built by Synspective as a demonstrator for their planned 25 satellite constellation. It will feature an X-band synthetic aperture radar.\r\n\r\nStriX \u03b2 is an upgraded version of the StriX \u03b1 prototype. The satellite features two deployable panes, one side carrying solar cells, the other carrying the X-band radar antenna.\r\n\r\nThe StriX satellite constellation can target data with a ground resolution of 1-3 m, single polarized (VV), and a swath width of more than 10-30 km. The StriX observation modes are Stripmap and Sliding Spotlight mode and each satellite has an SAR antenna that is 5 meters in length and stowed during launch. The simple design of the satellites allows for affordable development of the constellation.\r\n\r\nStriX \u03b2 was planned to be launched in 2021 on a Soyuz-2-1a Fregat or Soyuz-2-1b Fregat rideshare mission, but as this mission was delayed, it was re-booked on a dedicated Electron KS launch.\r\n\r\nSynspective is planning a constellation of 25 satellites called StriX, comprised of 100-kilogram satellites capable of imaging at a resolution of one to three meters. By 2022 the company plans to have six satellites in orbit. The company has not set a date by which it hopes to achieve 25 satellites.",

It is owned and operated by private spaceflight company Rocket Lab and supports launches of the company's Electron rocket for small satellites. With the launch of Electron on 25 May 2017, it became the first private spaceport to host an orbital launch attempt, and the first site in New Zealand to host an orbital launch attempt. With the Electron launch of 21 January 2018, it became the first private spaceport to host a successful orbital launch.",
