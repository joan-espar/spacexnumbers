Together the satellites will provide a FOV of 100% all-sky. The sensitivity of the detectors is ~2E-8 erg/cm2/s. They will provide a localization of ~1\u00b0. The detectors are sensible in the energy band from 6 keV to 5 MeV.\r\n\r\nBesides detecting the radiation from gravitatinal wave events, the satellites will also be contributing in detectiong Ultra-long GRBs, X-ray Flashes, X-ray-rich GRBs, Magnetars and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.",
