Its payloads incorporate S-band, C-band and Ku-band transponders, which will provide satellite communication services. The S-band and C-band transponders will serve NTT DOCOMO, Inc., the largest telecommunications company in Japan, for its flexible mobile communications services in Japan and the surrounding region under IRU contract (Indefeasible Right of Use). SKY Perfect JSAT will support NTT DOCOMO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite communication services. JCSAT-17 also includes a flexible processor that will allow SJC to redirect capacity to concentrate on disaster relief efforts or other high-volume events. \r\n\r\nThe GEO-KOMPSAT-2 program is a national program of the Korean government to develop and operate two civilian geostationary satellites sharing the same satellite bus: GEO-KOMPSAT-2A for meteorological and space weather monitoring missions; and GEO-KOMPSAT-2B for Earth environment monitoring and ocean monitoring missions. The GEO-KOMPSAT 2 program also ensures the succession for the COMS program (Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite). The satellite carries two main payloads: GOCI II (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager II), provided by Airbus Defence and Space; and the GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer), provided by Ball Aerospace & Technologies.",
