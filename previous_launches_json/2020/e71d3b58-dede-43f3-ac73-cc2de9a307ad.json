The Demo-2 mission is the second test flight of Crew Dragon, and the first flight with crew onboard. It will carry NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station for an extended stay (the specific mission duration will be determined once on station based on the readiness of the next commercial crew launch). They will perform tests on Crew Dragon in addition to conducting research and other tasks with the space station crew. \n\nAs the final flight test for SpaceX, this mission will validate the company\u2019s crew transportation system, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities. This also will be the first time NASA astronauts will test the spacecraft systems in orbit. The Demo-2 mission will be the final major step before NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program certifies Crew Dragon for operational, long-duration missions to the space station.\n\nCurrent Mission Status:\nAfter a successful ride to orbit and stay at the International Space Station, the Dragon Spacecraft successfully made its way back to Earth. Capsule successfully landed in the Gulf of Mexico waters on 3rd August 2020 at 18:48 UTC.",
