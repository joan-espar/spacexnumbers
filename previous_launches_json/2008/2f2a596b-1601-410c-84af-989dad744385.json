WINDS was launched by an H-IIA Launch Vehicle in 2008 to establish the world's most advanced information and telecommunications network.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this information and telecommunications network's speed and capacity will be much higher than anything achieved previously. The WINDS satellite communication system aims for a maximum speed of 155 Mbps (receiving) / 6 Mbps (transmitting) for households with 45-centimeter aperture antennas (the same size as existing Communications Satellite antennas), and ultra-fast 1.2 Gbps transmission for offices with five-meter antennas.",

It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was formed, and is now run by JAXA. The activities that take place at TNSC include assembly, testing, launching, and tracking satellites, as well as rocket engine firing tests.",
