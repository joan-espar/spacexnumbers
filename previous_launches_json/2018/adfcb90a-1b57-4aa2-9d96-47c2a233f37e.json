The four satellites of the series will provide advanced imaging with increased spatial resolution and faster coverage for more accurate forecasts, real-time mapping of lightning activity, and improved monitoring of solar activity. GOES-S  will provide continuous imagery and atmospheric measurements of the Western Hemisphere. GOES-S will be the primary tool for the detection and tracking of hurricanes and severe weather. Once operational as GOES-17, the satellite wil replace GOES-15 satellite.",
