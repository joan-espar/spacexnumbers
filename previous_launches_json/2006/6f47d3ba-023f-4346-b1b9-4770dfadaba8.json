MiTEx will investigate and demonstrate advanced space technologies such as lightweight power and propulsion systems, avionics and spacecraft structures; commercial-off-the-shelf processors; affordable, responsive fabrication/build-to-launch techniques; and single-string components. The MITEx experiment will be deployed into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), from which the MITEx Upper stage will put the experiments into a geostationary orbit (GEO).",
