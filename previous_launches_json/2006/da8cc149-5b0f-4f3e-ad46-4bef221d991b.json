The satellite is continuously oriented towards the Earth in order to fulfill this program of Earth surface observation. The spacecraft was built by TsSKB Progress in Samara. It is based on the military Yantar-4KS1M (Neman) imaging satellite. The main sensor of the spacecraft is the Geoton-L1 optoelectronic push-broom imager. Panchromatic resolution at an altitude of 360 km is 0.9 m, at an altitude of 604 km it is 1.5 m. Multispectral resolution is between 1.5 and 2 m.",
