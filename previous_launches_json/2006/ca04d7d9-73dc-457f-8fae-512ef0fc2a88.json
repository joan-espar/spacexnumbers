ALOS as been given the nickname Daichi.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after spacecraft separation, ALOS began to unfurl its 72-foot solar array that will provide electrical power to the craft throughout its mission. Six cameras are on-board to visually verify the correct deployment of the solar panel and various instrument antennas.\r\n\r\nALOS lost all power on 22. April 2011, thus ending the mission.",
